Flame graph


Where is ltrace useful in debugging
- Multithreaded apps use the pthread library. Ltrace very useful for debugging multithreaded applications.
- Ltrace can give you times and counts of library functions that are being used by the application
   - giving a clue to which library call are taking lot of time and also bulk of time in % of time a function is comsuming.
   - So it is like a user space profiler
