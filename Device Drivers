Driver Methods
---------------

A device driver provides several entry points into the kernel. These are **file related system calls** known as drivers' methods. 
So, we can have an 
open() method,
a read() method,
a write() method, 
an llseek() method,
an [unlocked|compat]_ioctl() method,
a release() method, and so on.
